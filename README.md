**Institution:** [Linguapolis - University of Antwerp](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/centres/linguapolis/)  
**Status:** 🔄 On-going  
**Level:** C1+

#### My Experience

The classes are well-structured and cover a good amount of content. You're required to speak during every session—not excessively, but enough to ensure active participation. The course offers a variety of group and individual dynamics, and the tutor consistently ensures everyone gets speaking practice.

**Most Valuable Aspect:** The detailed feedback materials sent by the teacher one or two days after each session. These documents highlight what students did well and provide corrections for mistakes made during class. I've learned a significant amount of vocabulary through studying and reviewing these feedback materials.

**Key Takeaways:**
- Active speaking practice in every session
- Diverse group and individual activities
- High-quality, detailed feedback after each class
- Excellent vocabulary expansion through review materials
