## 📚 Book Study Plan

## � Reading for Pleasure

Beyond textbooks, I also read books for enjoyment to improve my English naturally. This includes novels, memoirs, and non-fiction on topics I love.

> ⚠️ **Lesson Learned:** I once made the mistake of starting with philosophy books (Stoicism). Result? 40+ new words per chapter — completely overwhelming! Now I choose books with accessible vocabulary that I can actually learn from without burning out.

### Currently Reading

| Cover | Title | Author | Genre |
|-------|-------|--------|-------|
| <img src="./media/covers/long-way-round.jpg" width="80"/> | **Long Way Round** | Ewan McGregor & Charley Boorman | Travel / Motorcycle Adventure |

**Institution:** [Linguapolis - University of Antwerp](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/centres/linguapolis/)  
**Status:** 🔄 On-going  
**Started:** November 18, 2025  
**Level:** C1+

#### My Experience

The classes are well-structured and cover a good amount of content. You're required to speak during every session—not excessively, but enough to ensure active participation. The course offers a variety of group and individual dynamics, and the tutor consistently ensures everyone gets speaking practice.

**Most Valuable Aspect:** The detailed feedback materials sent by the teacher one or two days after each session. These documents highlight what students did well and provide corrections for mistakes made during class. I've learned a significant amount of vocabulary through studying and reviewing these feedback materials.

**Key Takeaways:**
- Active speaking practice in every session
- Diverse group and individual activities
- High-quality, detailed feedback after each class
- Excellent vocabulary expansion through review materials

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

<details>
<summary><b>Why these specific books?</b></summary>

<br>

The Cambridge "English in Use" series is widely regarded as one of the best structured learning paths for self-study. Each book focuses on a specific skill (grammar, vocabulary, phrasal verbs, etc.) and provides:
- Clear explanations with examples
- Progressive difficulty levels
- Self-study friendly format
- Answer keys for independent learning
- Proven track record with millions of learners worldwide

I chose this progression based on my current B2 level and recommendations from language learning communities.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Can I use your study plan?</b></summary>

<br>

Absolutely! However, keep in mind this plan is designed for someone **starting at B2 level**. If you're at a different level:
- **A2-B1:** Start with Elementary/Pre-Intermediate versions of the Cambridge books
- **C1+:** Jump directly to Advanced books or focus on specialized areas

The key is to **assess your current level** first and adjust accordingly!

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How do you stay motivated?</b></summary>

<br>

Several strategies keep me going:
- 🎯 **Clear goal:** Applying to international programs require strong English
- ✈️ **Real-world practice:** I travel abroad frequently, which gives me constant contact with different people and cultures. These experiences already push me to use English extensively, and beyond studying abroad, I'm focused on improving my language skills to make these interactions even more meaningful and enriching
- 📈 **Visible progress:** This repository tracks my journey publicly
- 🤖 **AI tools:** Make learning more interactive and personalized
