\begin{grammarbox}[Grammar Summary: Past Perfect Continuous]
\textbf{Form:} \textit{had been} + \textbf{-ing} form of the verb

\vspace{0.3cm}

\begin{tabular}{ll}
\textbf{Affirmative:} & I/You/He/She/It/We/They \textbf{had been working} \\
\textbf{Negative:} & I/You/He/She/It/We/They \textbf{had not (hadn't) been working} \\
\textbf{Question:} & \textbf{Had} I/you/he/she/it/we/they \textbf{been working}? \\
\end{tabular}

\vspace{0.3cm}

\textbf{Main Uses:}
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=1.5cm]
    \item To talk about an activity that \textbf{started before a past moment and continued up to that moment}:\\
    \textit{``I had been waiting for an hour when the bus finally came.''}
    
    \item To explain \textbf{why something was happening} at a past moment (cause → visible result):\\
    \textit{``He was tired because he had been running.''}
    
    \item Often used with \textbf{for} (duration) and \textbf{since} (starting point):\\
    \textit{``They had been living there for 20 years before they moved.''}
