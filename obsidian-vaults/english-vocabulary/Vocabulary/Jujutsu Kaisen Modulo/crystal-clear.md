## 📜 Etymology
From the 1500s; originates from Greek *krýstallos* ("ice"). "Clear as crystal" has been used since biblical times (Revelation 21:11). By the late 1800s — used by Dickens and Conan Doyle — it had become a cliché.

> - Stronger than simply saying "clear" or "obvious" — adds dramatic emphasis.
> - Antonym: *(as) clear as mud* (humorous — confusing).
> - Neutral to informal register; suitable for professional, academic, and casual contexts.
