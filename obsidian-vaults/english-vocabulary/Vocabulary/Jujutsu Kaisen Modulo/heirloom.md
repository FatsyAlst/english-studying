## 📜 Etymology
Compound of *heir* (from Old French *eir*, from Latin *heres* "heir") + *loom* (from Old English *gelōma* "tool, implement, utensil"). The "loom" in "heirloom" is unrelated to the weaving machine — it originally meant any tool or household object. Over time, the word narrowed to mean any valued possession passed down through a family.
