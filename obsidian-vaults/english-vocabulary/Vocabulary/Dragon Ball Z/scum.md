Comes from Middle Dutch "schume" and related Germanic forms meaning "foam, froth," originally referring to the layer on top of liquid. The figurative sense "lowest class of humanity, despicable people" is attested from the late 16th century and became common in expressions like "scum of the earth."

> [!tip] Notes
> - The concrete, physical sense (layer on liquid) is neutral and common in scientific or everyday contexts.
> - The insult sense is very strong; in many contexts, it is harsher than simple swear words because it dehumanizes the person or group.
> - This sense is highly offensive and expresses very strong disapproval; it should be used with caution, because it can sound very harsh or hateful.
> - Often appears in fixed expressions like "the scum of the earth" to emphasize that someone is seen as the worst kind of person.
