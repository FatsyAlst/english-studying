> [!tip] Notes
> - Meaning: it’s about price, not physical pain.
> - Often used in casual speech to complain about being overcharged.
> - DBZ note: In the Funimation English dub of the DBZ movie Dead Zone, a character says ‘pay through the eyes’ — a misheard/altered twist on this idiom. In context it’s delivered as a threat, so it carries a vengeful ‘you’ll suffer / you’ll pay dearly’ tone rather than a literal ‘you’ll overpay.’
> - Origin note: The idiom is recorded in English for centuries, but the exact origin is uncertain.
