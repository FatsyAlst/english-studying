| Part of Speech | Forms |
|----------------|-------|
| Adjective | safe, unsafe, safely |
| Adverb | safely |

---
- arrive/come back/get home + safe and sound
- be/return/remain + safe and sound
- keep someone/something + safe and sound
- I'm just glad you're safe and sound.

---
Safe and sound goes back at least to Middle English; sound was used with the sense whole, uninjured, healthy. The collocation was already established by the late 16th century and appears in Shakespeare, which helped fix it in literary English.

---
> [!tip] Notes
> - The idiom is commonly used to express relief and reassurance after danger, stress, or uncertainty (travels, surgery, accidents, natural disasters, etc.).
> - Grammatically, it functions like an adjective after verbs such as be, arrive, come back, get home, or with verbs of motion: They came back safe and sound, I'm safe and sound now.
> - Safe focuses on being out of danger; sound keeps its older meaning of healthy, whole, undamaged, so together they reinforce the idea of complete wellbeing.
