**Word:** Inbreeding

**Type:** Noun

**Pronunciation:** /ˈɪnbriːdɪŋ/ (IN-bree-ding)

**Definition:** The interbreeding of closely related individuals especially to preserve and fix desirable characters of and to eliminate unfavorable characters from a stock. The production of offspring from the mating or breeding of individuals or organisms that are closely related genetically. This results in increased homozygosity and can lead to both beneficial trait preservation and harmful genetic effects.

**Examples:**
• The genetics of the Angel Island coyotes show a lot of inbreeding.
• With the genomic data, conservationists could avoid issues that arise with inbreeding, like low fertility and weak immune systems.
• When the population of a species dwindles, the remaining animals are forced to inbreed and the genetic pool shrinks.

---

🔹 **ETYMOLOGY:**

Formed within English by compounding: "in-" (prefix meaning "within" or "into") + "breeding" (from the verb "breed"). The term emerged from the practice of selective breeding, particularly in agriculture and animal husbandry, where breeding within a limited gene pool became a deliberate practice.

---

🔹 **WORD FAMILY:**
• **Noun:** inbreeding
• **Verb:** inbreed / inbreeds / inbred / inbreeding
• **Adjective:** inbred
• **Related terms:** inbreeding depression, inbreeding coefficient, linebreeding
• **Opposite:** outbreeding, outcrossing

---

🔹 **COMMON COLLOCATIONS:**

**Adjectives describing inbreeding:**
• high inbreeding, biparental inbreeding
• severe inbreeding, excessive inbreeding
• resultant inbreeding depression

**Effects and consequences:**
• inbreeding depression (reduced fitness)
• inbreeding depression in wild populations
• inbreeding within sublines

**Verbs commonly used:**
• forced to inbreed
• suffer from inbreeding
• increase inbreeding
• prevent/avoid inbreeding
• animals often do not avoid inbreeding

**Common contexts:**
• inbreeding rate, inbreeding coefficient
• levels of inbreeding
• threats from inbreeding

---

🔹 **USAGE NOTES:**

**Two Main Contexts:**

**1. Selective Breeding (Agriculture/Animal Husbandry):**
• Inbreeding is a technique used in selective breeding.
• In livestock breeding, breeders may use inbreeding when trying to establish a new and desirable trait in the stock.
• Purpose: To "fix" desirable characteristics and create distinct family lines
• Requires careful monitoring for undesirable traits

**2. Conservation Biology/Population Genetics:**
• In extreme cases, this usually leads to at least temporarily decreased biological fitness of a population (called inbreeding depression).
• Occurs naturally in small, isolated populations
• Generally viewed as problematic for wild populations

**Inbreeding Depression:**
Inbreeding depression is the reduced biological fitness caused by loss of genetic diversity as a result of inbreeding.

This reduction of fitness occurs because inbreeding increases genetic similarity, which can amplify harmful genes and overall decreases diversity.

Effects include:
• High rate of neonatal mortality
• Low fertility and weak immune systems
• Congenital defects
• Reduced survival rates

**In Human Populations:**
• By analogy, the term is used in human reproduction, but more commonly refers to the genetic disorders and other consequences that may arise from expression of deleterious recessive traits resulting from incestuous sexual relationships and consanguinity.
• Offspring of biologically related persons are subject to the possible effects of inbreeding, such as congenital birth defects.
• The chances of such disorders are increased when the biological parents are more closely related.

**Genetic Mechanism:**
• Inbreeding results in homozygosity which can increase the chances of offspring being affected by recessive traits.
• Such pairings have a 25% probability of producing homozygous zygotes, resulting in offspring with two recessive alleles.
• Because close relatives share a large fraction of their alleles, the probability that any such deleterious allele is inherited from the common ancestor through both parents is increased dramatically.

**Benefits of Inbreeding:**
• Inbreeding can result in purging of deleterious alleles from a population through purifying selection.
• Increased homozygosity increases the probability of fixing beneficial alleles.
• Used to reveal deleterious recessive alleles for elimination
• Important tool in plant and animal breeding

**In Plant Breeding:**
• In plant breeding, inbred lines are used as stocks for the creation of hybrid lines to make use of the effects of heterosis.
• Inbreeding in plants also occurs naturally in the form of self-pollination.

**Related Concepts:**
• **Linebreeding:** A milder form focusing on specific ancestors
• **Outcrossing/Outbreeding:** Mating between unrelated individuals
• **Heterosis (Hybrid Vigor):** The "mirror image" of inbreeding depression

**Register:**
• Neutral to formal
• Technical/scientific term
• Common in:
  - Genetics and biology
  - Conservation science
  - Animal and plant breeding
  - Medical genetics
  - Evolutionary biology

**Synonyms:**
Consanguineous breeding, close breeding (in agriculture)

**Antonyms:**
Outbreeding, outcrossing, crossbreeding
